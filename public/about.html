<h1>A short bit about me...DC</h1>

<p>I like learning new things.  I like gadgets and gizmos.  I am interested in how things work, particularly
  as they relate to electronics and networking.  I'm hoping this course will lead me on a path to more network design.
  I guess we shall see.</p>

<p>I don't believe that everyone can just pick up on coding (or any other worthy task) easily without an interest in
  that particular subject.  I think it takes work and a desire to learn.  I'm looking forward to gaining more experience
  and to the possibility of developing a new hobby or part-time business, AKA side-hustle.
